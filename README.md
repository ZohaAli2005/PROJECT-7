# PROJECT-7
This project is a responsive YouTube Clone User Interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to replicate the core layout and visual structure of the original YouTube platform, including the navigation bar, search section, category filters, and video grid system. The main objective of this project is to practice front-end development concepts such as responsive design, layout management using Flexbox and Grid, and component-based UI structuring. Working on this project helped improve my skills in creating modern, user-friendly web interfaces and understanding real-world website layouts. This project is intended for learning and practice purposes and demonstrates my progress in front-end web development.
